### C++ Challenges
A file that contains a plethora of skills for coding in C++.  Although you will find most of the code commented out, there are multiple sections which each deomonstrate the fundamentals of coding in C++.
### Calculator
A simple console calculator that uses C++ operators.

### OOP Submission Assignment
An assignment for the tech academy that uses OOP.  A Dog Class is created with simple methods and a constructor, and in the main program instatiates an object of that class with specific features and calls the class inherited methods.

### MyProject3 a.k.a. Crypt Walker
A platform game built entirely in Unreal.  The player must navigate a series of puzzles while collecting keys in order to unlock the final checkpoint.  It includes level sequences for moving platforms, item pickups, jump boosts, damage dealing obstacles and a sprawled out base terrain that were all created from scratch.  It highlights visual scripting prowess and the ability to switch from a code scripting engine like Unity to a visual scripting engine that is Unreal.
